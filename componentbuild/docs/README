YUI uses ANT to create component build files from individual 
source files.

Each component has it's own ANT build script residing in the component's 
"src" folder, with an associated properties file used to configure the 
default build properties e.g:

	yui2/src/autocomplete/build.xml
	yui2/src/autocomplete/build.properties

The component build scripts will automate the conversion from component 
source to <component>.js, <component>-min.js, <component>-debug.js by: 

  a). Concatenating individual source files
  b). Stripping logger statements
  c). Running yuicompressor
  d). Running jslint all 3 built files
  e). Adding boiler plate module/version registration code
  f). Building skin files from <component>-core.css and <component>-skin.css
  g). Deploying built JS, CSS and assets to <project>/build

The same component build system is also used for CSS components such as 
reset, base, fonts and grids.

The scripts currently do not check in any code. The developer is 
responsible for checking modified source code into the <project>/src 
directory, and built code into the <project>/build directory, allowing 
them to review diffs, before commiting changes.

Below is a step-by-step guide installing the build system, allowing
you to build the "src" component code.

SHORT VERSION

1). Install ANT 1.7 or above, and add ant to your path

2). Clone the YUI "builder" project from http://github.com/yui/builder/

3). At the command line, cd to the source directory of the component 
    you wish to build, and execute "ant all" to build, e.g.: 

    cd yui2/src/autocomplete
    ant all

DETAILED VERSION

To use the build system, you'll need to install ANT and obtain
the YUI build infrastructure scripts from github. 

These are one-time install tasks.

INSTALLING ANT

1). Download and install ANT 1.7 (or above)

    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

2). Set ANT_HOME to point to your ANT install root and add 
    $ANT_HOME/bin/ant to your PATH

INSTALLING YUI SCRIPTS

1). Clone the YUI "builder" project from github:

    http://github.com/yui/builder/

2). Out of the box, the build system is designed to work
    when cloned to the default "builder" directory, parallel 
    to the project source directories:

    <gitroot>/yui2       [ cloned yui2 project ]
	<gitroot>/yui3		 [ cloned yui2 project ]
	<gitroot>/builder    [ cloned builder project ]

	Cloning it to the default location will allow you to 
	build any of the components without having to modify any 
	component build scripts.

BUILDING AN EXISTING COMPONENT

You should now be able run the build.xml file in any component's
src folder, to build the component by typing in "ant all", e.g:

   At the command prompt:

      cd yui2/src/autocomplete
      ant all

The "all" build target will build the autocomplete component from it's
source files and deploy the built files to the yui2/build/autocomplete 
folder.

If you just type in "ant", without a target specified, it will 
execute the default target, "local", which will build files to the 
temporary src/<component>/build_tmp directory, without deploying
them to the top level build directory.

   At the command prompt:

      cd yui2/src/autocomplete
	  ant

ANT will output build information to screen, as it runs through the 
build, which can be redirected to a file if required:

   prompt>ant all

     Buildfile: build.xml
        [echo] Starting Build For autocomplete
        ...
        [echo]     builddir : ../../../builder/componentbuild
        ...
        ...
     BUILD SUCCESSFUL
     Total time: 7 seconds

   prompt>

NOTE: Most components will have warnings which are output during the 
"minify" and "lint" steps, which the component developer has evaluated 
and determined to have no impact on functionality.
